# ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„

All my 2022's Advent of Code in Rust.

Some days are really brute-forcey.


# How to run

From the `xanathar` directory, then run with:

```
cargo run -- <testname> [<testname> [<testname>]..]..
```

Where `<testname>` is `1a`, `1b`, `2a`, `2b`... `25a`, `25b`.

For example to run the second test of December 19th:

```
cargo run -- 19b
```

Or to run all the tests of December 19th:

```
cargo run -- 19a 19b
```
